  "bioShort": "Stockholm-based producer & DJ blending distorted soul, ambient noise and heavy club energy.",
  "bioLong": "Thirty3 is a Stockholm-based producer and DJ exploring the space between art music and the club. His releases weave distorted soul, ambient noise and post-club rhythms into cinematic textures—equal parts intimate and abrasive. Recent work includes the album “Memories of Noise” and the single “The Call Below”, alongside DJ sets across underground venues in Sweden and Europe. On stage, Thirty3 moves from tense atmospheres into weighty breakbeats and dubstep pressure, keeping a raw, emotional throughline. Visuals follow the same aesthetic—glitch, lifted blacks, teal haze. Thirty3 is currently open for bookings, remixes and cross-disciplinary collaborations.",
