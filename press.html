    <h2>Long bio</h2>
    <p>
      Thirty3 is a Stockholm-based producer and DJ exploring the space between art music and the club.
      His releases weave distorted soul, ambient noise and post-club rhythms into cinematic textures—equal
      parts intimate and abrasive. Recent work includes the album “Memories of Noise” and the single
      “The Call Below”, alongside DJ sets across underground venues in Sweden and Europe. On stage, Thirty3
      moves from tense atmospheres into weighty breakbeats and dubstep pressure, keeping a raw, emotional
      throughline. Visuals follow the same aesthetic—glitch, lifted blacks, teal haze. Thirty3 is currently
      open for bookings, remixes and cross-disciplinary collaborations.
